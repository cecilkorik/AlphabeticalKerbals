This is a plugin for Kerbal Space Program to alphabetize the list of Kerbals.

This should make it easier to find the individual you are looking for in a long
list, or simply make the list look tidier and more organized for anyone who
prefers their Kerbals to be in alphabetical order instead of always having the
most recent hires at the bottom.
